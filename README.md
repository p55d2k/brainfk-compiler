## About üìñ

brainfk compiler is an attempt to create a compiler for the brainf\*\*k programming language. This project is created to learn more about compilers and how they work. The project is written in Python and does not use any external libraries (other than the standard library and colors). Some of the code is inspired by the [BF-it](https://github.com/elikaski/BF-it/tree/master) github repository.
