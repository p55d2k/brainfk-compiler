# brainfk-compiler CHANGELOG

## v1.0.1 - 14/4/24
- Added a decoder. (However, it is not the best implementation and is not recommended for large files.)
- Added a new command line argument to specify the output file name. (Use `--output` or `-o` to specify the output file name.)

## v1.0.0 - 14/4/24
- Initial release of the brainfk compiler.
